                    Sometime after the mission in the Bermuda System, the Galactic Federation announces that Metroids are too dangerous to be left alive. After failing multiple times to eradicate them, the Federation sends Samus to destroy the remaining Metroids on their
                    homeworld: SR388. After killing the final Metroid, she finds an unhatched Metroid egg, and a baby hatches from it. Samus prepares to destroy it, but the Baby Metroid had already imprinted Samus as its mother. Proteus Ridley, the final
                    cybernetic form of Ridley, attempts to steal the baby Metroid but fails. Samus then gives the Baby to the Space Science Academy for further research into the Metroid species.

                    Samus returns to planet SR388 as a bodyguard for Biologic's research team, but is infected by the X-Parasite. Her Power Suit is surgically removed by Federation doctors and she is given a vaccine that contains Metroid DNA. This gives her Power Suit the
                    ability to absorb X-Parasites, but also gives her a weakness to ice. Samus is sent to search the Biologic Space Laboratories research station for a disturbance that appeared. The researchers attempted to contain Samus's original infected
                    Power Suit, but it turned out to be an X mimicking Samus- The SA-X. The SA-X released other X-Parasites to infect the entire station; while Samus works to stop the infection, she discovers a secret lab with Metroids which the SA-X
                    destroys. She also discovers that there are at least 10 SA-X through the X's asexual reproduction. With the help of the ship's computer, a digital version of Adam Malkovich, she crashes the station into SR388, destroying all X on the
                    station and the planet.
